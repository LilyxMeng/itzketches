            <p class="question">HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN DRAWING FOR?</p>
            <p class="answer">I’ve been drawing since 2016, so for about 5 years!</p>
            <p class="question">WHERE ARE YOU BASED IN?</p>
            <p class="answer">I’m based in Canada! :D</p>
            <p class="question">HOW OLD ARE YOU?</p>

            <h2 class="faq-subtitle">DEVICES/PROGRAMS/MATERIALS</h2>
            <p class="question">WHAT DEVICE DO YOU USE TO DRAW?</p>
            <p class="answer">I use an iPad Pro 11” for my digital artworks!<p>
            <p class="question">WHAT PROGRAMS DO YOU USE FOR YOUR DIGITAL ARTWORKS?</p>
            <p class="answer">The main program I use is Procreate, however, I sometimes switch to clip studio paint (rarely) because they have better pixels, in my opinion.</p>
            <p class="question">WHAT BRUSHES DO YOU USE?</p>
            <p class="answer">I mainly use the 6B pencil for sketching, the Gesinski Ink for inking, and the Flat Brush for shading, and also the Soft Brush.</p>
            <p class="question">DO YOU DO TRADITIONAL ARTWORK?</p>
            <p class="answer">Not that often anymore, but I do still draw with a pencil now and then! It’s kinda a lot easier to draw via digitally since there is less of a mess and a lot easier.<p>
            <p class="question">DO YOU USE WATERCOLOUR? AND IF SO, WHAT BRANDS DO YOU USE?</p>
            <p class="answer">Yes! I love watercolours! They were my favourite mediums aside from Copic markers.<p>
            <p class="answer">I use multiple brands of watercolours:</p>
            <ol class="list">
                <li>Schmincke Horadam Aquarell</li>
                <li>QoR</li>
                <li>Sennellier</li>
                <li>M. Graham</li>

            <h3 class="faq-subtitle">PRINTS INFORMATION</h3>
            <p class="question">ARE THE PRINTS MADE OUT OF CARDSTOCK?</p>
            <p class="answer">No, the prints I sell currently are not made from cardstock. They are on photo paper with a matte or glossy finish. However, I am working on getting new prints in the near future that will be cardstock! So stay tuned!<p>
            <p class="question">HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE FOR OUR ORDER TO ARRIVE?</p>
            <p class="answer">The estimated time that standard mail takes to arrive is between 5-14 business days. Due to COVID-19, there may be delays, unfortunately.</p>
            <p class="question">WHAT HAPPENS IF OUR ORDERS DON’T ARRIVE WITHIN THE DESIGNATED TIME?</p>
            <p class="answer">Given the circumstances, I would ask you to please contact me through my <a class="link" href="contact.html">email</a> or my direct messages on <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/itzketches/">Instagram</a>. I will try my best to ensure that everyone receives their order!</p>
